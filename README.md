<h1> General Information </h1>
--> Text from http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/

<b>OpenDrop</b> is a new design for an open source digital microfludics platform for research purposes. The device uses recent electro-wetting technology to control small droplets of liquids. Potential applications are lab on a chip devices for automating processes of digital biology. How ever the present design should also open the technology to other field and allow experimentation to find new applications. Including the field of art, music, games and education.

The design approach chosen relies strongly on Do-It-Your-Self (DIY) and Low-Cost. To aim is to only use standard and widely-available components, materials, and production processes. We try to avoid parts that arenâ€™t available to individual customers or processes that require expensive setup costs. Also all design files and software required to operate your hardware are shared under open licenses.
